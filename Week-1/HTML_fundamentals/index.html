    <p>
        I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br> 
        
        Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
        
        Then there's a pair of us!<br>
        
        Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br>
        
        How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
        
        How public - like a Frog -<br>
    </p>
      <p>To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>
      
    <p>By Emily Dickinson (1891)</p>
